* **OpenMetadata:** A relatively new but rapidly growing project, OpenMetadata aims to be a comprehensive open-source data discovery and metadata platform. It offers a rich set of features, including:
    * **Automated Metadata Ingestion:** Connects to various data sources to automatically extract metadata.
    * **Data Lineage:** Tracks the flow of data from source to destination.
    * **Data Profiling:** Analyzes data to understand its characteristics.
    * **Collaboration & Data Discovery:** Enables users to search, discover, and document data assets.
    * **API-First Architecture:**  Allows for easy integration with other tools.

* **Amundsen:** Developed by Lyft, Amundsen is a data discovery and metadata engine. Key features include:
    * **Search:** Powerful search functionality to find datasets and tables.
    * **Data Lineage:** Visualizes data lineage to understand data flow.
    * **Table and Column Level Metadata:** Detailed information about data assets.

**Key Considerations When Choosing:**

* **Ease of Deployment and Maintenance:** Consider the complexity of setting up and maintaining the catalog.
* **Scalability:** Choose a tool that can handle the growth of your data and user base.
* **Features:** Identify the features that are most important to your needs, such as data lineage, data profiling, and search functionality.
* **Community Support:** A strong community can provide valuable assistance and contribute to the project's long-term sustainability.
* **Integration with Existing Tools:** Ensure the catalog can integrate with your existing data infrastructure and tools.


Before making a decision, it's recommended to try out a few different tools to see which one best fits your specific requirements.  Consider factors like the size of your organization, the complexity of your data landscape, and your team's technical expertise.
