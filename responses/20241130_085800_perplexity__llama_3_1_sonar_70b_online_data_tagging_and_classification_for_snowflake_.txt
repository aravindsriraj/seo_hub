Data tagging and classification in Snowflake are crucial for managing sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and enhancing data governance. Here’s a detailed overview of how these processes work:

## Types of Classifiers

Snowflake offers two primary types of data classifiers:

### System Classifiers
- These are pre-defined classifiers provided by Snowflake to identify common sensitive data types such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, and more. System classifiers automatically identify and tag sensitive data based on standard patterns[1][2][4].

### Custom Classifiers
- Custom classifiers allow users to define their own rules for identifying specific types of sensitive data that are unique to their organization. These classifiers use regular expressions to match column value patterns and can be particularly useful for data that doesn't fit standard patterns. Custom classifiers reside in the `SNOWFLAKE.DATA_PRIVACY` schema and require the `SNOWFLAKE.CLASSIFICATION_ADMIN` database role to be created and managed[1][3][4].

## Process of Data Classification

### Using SQL
- To classify data using SQL, you need to have the necessary permissions, such as `USAGE` on the warehouse and `SELECT` on the table.
- You can use the `SYSTEM$CLASSIFY` function to classify tables and apply tags. This function can be used with both system and custom classifiers, and it allows for auto-tagging of columns based on the classification results[1][3][4].

### Using Snowsight UI
- Snowflake's Snowsight UI provides a user-friendly interface for data classification. You can navigate to a schema, select tables, and run the classification job. The UI allows for auto-tagging and the option to include custom classifiers. You can review and adjust the classification results directly within Snowsight[2][4].

## Tagging Data

### Tag Definition and Assignment
- Tags are schema-level objects in Snowflake that are used to categorize and describe data. To use tags, you first need to define them with a name, an optional comment, and optional allowed values. Once defined, tags can be applied to various Snowflake objects such as tables, columns, databases, and warehouses[5].

### Applying Tags
- Tags can be applied manually or automatically through the classification process. For example, after running a classification job, you can auto-apply tags to the classified columns. Manual adjustments can also be made through the Snowsight UI or using SQL commands[1][2][5].

## Security and Compliance

- Data classification and tagging in Snowflake are integral to maintaining data privacy and compliance. By applying appropriate tags, you can set up masking policies and row access policies to protect sensitive information. This ensures adherence to regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA[1][2][4].

## Best Practices

- Regular review of your data classification strategy is essential to ensure ongoing data protection and compliance.
- Combining custom classifiers with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps implement granular access controls for sensitive data.
- Automating the process of creating and assigning tags can be achieved using tools like phData’s Provision Tool, which simplifies managing Snowflake resource lifecycles[1][3][5].

By leveraging these features and best practices, organizations can effectively identify, classify, and protect sensitive data within their Snowflake environment.
