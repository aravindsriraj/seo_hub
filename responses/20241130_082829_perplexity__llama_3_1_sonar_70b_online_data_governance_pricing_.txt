The pricing for data governance tools can be complex and varies widely based on several factors, including the vendor, the number of users, the volume of data, and the specific features required. Here are some key points to consider:

## Pricing Models
Data governance tools often use various pricing models:
- **Subscription-based pricing**: Many tools charge on a monthly or annual basis, with costs per user or per asset[1][3][5].
- **Usage-based pricing**: This model charges based on the amount of data or the number of governed assets. For example, Microsoft Purview charges based on the number of unique governed assets per day and data management processing units (DGPUs) per run[2][5].
- **Perpetual licensing**: Some tools offer a one-time payment for lifetime use, although this is less common in modern data governance solutions[1].

## Cost Range
The costs can range significantly:
- **Basic solutions**: Tools like Microsoft Purview, Segment, and Atlan can start as low as $10 per user per month[1][2][3].
- **Advanced solutions**: Enterprise-grade tools like Talend, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and Teradata Vantage can cost several thousand dollars per month. For instance, Collibra's annual licensing can range from $170,000 to $510,000 depending on the plan[1][4].

## Specific Examples
- **Microsoft Purview**: Charges $0.0165 per asset per day (~ $0.50 per month) for data catalog managed assets. Additional costs are incurred for data health management actions based on DGPUs, ranging from $15 to $240 per DGPU depending on the SKU[2][5].
- **Collibra**: Offers yearly licensing starting at $170,000 for a 12-month plan, with higher plans costing up to $510,000 for a 36-month plan[4].
- **Talend**: Can cost around $1,000 per user per month (billed annually)[1].

## Hidden and Additional Costs
When evaluating the total cost of ownership, consider the following:
- **Implementation and ongoing costs**: Time and resources spent on setting up and maintaining the tool[3].
- **Training costs**: Necessary for ensuring users can effectively use the tool[3].
- **Add-on costs**: Additional features or integrations with third-party systems can incur extra costs[3][4].
- **User licensing fees**: Different roles (e.g., admins, viewers, authors) may be priced differently[4].

## Free and Trial Options
Some tools offer free tiers or trial versions, though these typically have limited functionality:
- **Microsoft Purview**: Offers a free trial for its data governance solution[2].
- **Informatica Cloud Data Quality**: Has a free tier with limited features[1].

In summary, the cost of data governance tools can be highly variable and depends on a multitude of factors, including the tool's features, the size and complexity of the organization, and the specific needs of the data governance practice.
