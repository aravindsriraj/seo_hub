It allows users to connect to various data sources, build knowledge graphs, and collaborate on data projects.  It has a strong community aspect.\n* **Atlan:**  Focused on active metadata management, Atlan excels in data discovery and collaboration. It offers automated data quality checks, integrates with popular data tools, and emphasizes ease of use.  Stronger in the modern data stack space.\n* **Stemma:** This open-source data catalog focuses on data lineage, impact analysis, and data quality. It is a good option for organizations looking for a cost-effective solution with a strong technical foundation.  Requires more technical expertise to set up and maintain.\n\n\n**Data Discovery Focused:**\n\n* **Amazon DataZone:** A newer offering from AWS, DataZone focuses on making data discoverable and accessible across organizational boundaries. Tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem.\n* **Google Data Catalog:** Google's fully managed data discovery and metadata management service. Integrates well with other Google Cloud services.  Good for organizations already invested in the Google Cloud Platform.\n* **Azure Purview:** Microsoft's unified data governance service that helps users discover and manage data across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments.
