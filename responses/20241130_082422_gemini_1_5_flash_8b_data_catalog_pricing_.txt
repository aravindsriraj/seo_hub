**Common Pricing Models:**

* **Subscription:** A recurring monthly or annual fee based on users or features.
* **Usage-based:** Pricing tied to data volume, query frequency, or other metrics.
* **Per-dataset/asset:** A fee structured around each data asset included in the catalog.
* **Custom:** Tailored plans designed to meet specific project requirements.

**To get a clearer picture of data catalog pricing, you should:**

1. **Identify your needs:** What specific functionalities do you require? How many users and datasets will be included? What integrations are required?

2. **Research vendors:** Explore different data catalog providers that align with your requirements. Look at their websites and contact them for pricing information.

3. **Compare pricing models:** Analyze the differences in pricing structures and features offered by various vendors.
