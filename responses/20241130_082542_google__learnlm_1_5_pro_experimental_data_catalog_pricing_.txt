Data catalog pricing varies greatly depending on the vendor, the features offered, and the size of your organization. There are several common pricing models:

**1. Per User/Seat:** This model charges a fixed fee per user per month or year.  It's common for tools with a focus on collaboration and self-service data discovery.  The price per user can vary based on the type of user (e.g., read-only vs. editor) and the features included.

* **Pros:** Predictable cost based on team size; easy to understand and budget.
* **Cons:** Can become expensive for large organizations with many users, even if they don't actively use the catalog.  May discourage broad adoption due to cost.


**2. Per Data Asset/Entity:** This model charges based on the number of data assets (tables, columns, reports, etc.) cataloged. It's suitable for organizations with a large volume of data assets.

* **Pros:**  Cost scales directly with data volume; incentivizes efficient data management.
* **Cons:** Difficult to predict costs upfront if data volume fluctuates; may discourage cataloging all data assets due to cost.


**3. Usage-Based/Consumption:** This model charges based on the amount of data scanned, processed, or queried within the catalog.  It often applies to catalogs integrated with data processing platforms.

* **Pros:** Pay only for what you use; cost-effective for occasional or sporadic use.
* **Cons:** Difficult to predict costs; potential for unexpected cost spikes with increased usage.


**4. Tiered Pricing:** This model offers different pricing tiers with varying features and usage limits.  Higher tiers typically offer more advanced features, greater scalability, and support for larger organizations.  This is a very common model.

* **Pros:** Flexibility to choose a tier that meets your needs and budget; scalability as your needs grow.
* **Cons:**  May need to upgrade to a higher tier as data volume or usage increases; features may be restricted in lower tiers.


**5. Open Source with Commercial Support:** Some open-source data catalog solutions offer commercial support subscriptions for enterprise users. This can provide access to expert support, advanced features, and enterprise-grade security.

* **Pros:** Lower initial cost; flexibility to customize; community support.
* **Cons:**  Support costs can vary; requires internal expertise to manage and maintain; may lack some enterprise features.


**Factors Affecting Pricing:**

* **Number of users:** More users generally mean higher costs for per-user pricing models.
* **Data volume:**  Larger data volumes lead to higher costs for per-asset or usage-based models.
* **Features:** Advanced features like data lineage, data quality monitoring, and automated metadata discovery usually come at a premium.
* **Deployment:** Cloud-based solutions typically have subscription-based pricing, while on-premise solutions may involve perpetual licenses and maintenance fees.
* **Support level:**  Different levels of support (e.g., basic email support vs. 24/7 phone support) will affect the price.


**Examples of Data Catalog Vendors and Their Pricing Models (General - Subject to Change):**

* **Alation:** Tiered subscription pricing based on the number of users and features.
* **Collibra:** Tiered subscription pricing based on features and data assets.
* **data.world:** Tiered subscription pricing based on users and usage.
* **Google Data Catalog:** Usage-based pricing based on API requests and stored metadata.
* **AWS Glue Data Catalog:** Pay-as-you-go pricing based on stored metadata and crawled data.


**Recommendation:**

It's crucial to **contact vendors directly** for accurate and up-to-date pricing information.  Request a demo and discuss your specific requirements to get a tailored quote.  Consider factors like your data volume, number of users, required features, and budget when evaluating different options.  Don't forget to factor in the total cost of ownership, including implementation, training, and ongoing maintenance.
