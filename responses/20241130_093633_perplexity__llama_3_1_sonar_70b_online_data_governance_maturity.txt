Data governance maturity refers to the stage an organization has reached in implementing and adopting data governance initiatives. Here are some key points and models that help understand and assess data governance maturity:

## Definition and Purpose
Data governance maturity models are tools and methodologies used to measure an organization's data governance initiatives and communicate them effectively across the organization. These models help organizations evaluate their current state, identify areas for improvement, and create a roadmap to achieve higher levels of data governance maturity[2][4][5].

## Common Data Governance Maturity Models

### Gartner Data Governance Maturity Model
Gartner's model is part of its Enterprise Information Management Maturity Model and includes seven key building blocks:
- Vision
- Strategy
- Metrics
- Information governance
- Organization and roles
- Information life cycle
- Enabling infrastructure

The model categorizes organizations into five levels:
- **Level 1: Aware** - Organizations recognize issues but lack the resources to address them.
- **Level 2: Reactive** - Organizations start to address data governance issues reactively.
- **Level 3: Proactive** - Organizations anticipate and prevent data governance issues.
- **Level 4: Managed** - Organizations have an enterprise-wide data governance program with documented policies and procedures.
- **Level 5: Optimized** - Organizations have a fully automated information asset management system with high-quality, governed, and secured data embedded into daily workflows[3][5].

### Oracle Data Governance Maturity Model
Oracle's model includes six levels:
- **Milestone one: None (level 0)** - No formal governance processes are in place.
- **Milestone two: Initial (level 1)** - IT has some authority over data, but with limited influence on business processes.
- **Milestone three: Managed (level 2)** - Data governance starts to be integrated into IT and business processes.
- **Milestone four: Monitored (level 3)** - Data governance is more formalized with monitoring in place.
- **Milestone five: Measured (level 4)** - Data governance metrics are used to measure performance.
- **Milestone six: Optimized (level 5)** - Continuous improvement and optimization of data governance processes[1].

### Ovaledge Data Governance Maturity Model
The Ovaledge model focuses on three core areas: data quality, data access management, and data literacy. It includes five levels:
- **Level 1: Unaware** - No awareness of the importance of data governance.
- **Level 2: Aware** - Awareness of data governance issues but no action taken.
- **Level 3: Defined** - Data governance rules, policies, and roles are defined.
- **Level 4: Implemented** - Data governance policies are enforced, and training is conducted.
- **Level 5: Optimized** - Rules and policies are optimized for better efficiency, and data is tagged for increased discoverability[2][4].

### IBM Data Governance Maturity Model
IBM's model assesses progress across 11 core data governance areas, including data awareness, data policy, data stewardship, and compliance. It includes several levels:
- **Level 1: Initial** - Limited to no data processes or governance.
- **Level 2: Managed** - Basic data governance processes are in place.
- **Level 3: Defined** - Data governance is more formalized with defined roles and policies.
- **Level 4: Quantitatively Managed** - Data governance metrics are used to measure performance.
- **Level 5: Optimizing** - Continuous improvement and optimization of data governance processes[2].

## Using a Data Governance Maturity Model
To use these models effectively:
- Conduct an assessment of the current state of data governance, including existing processes, infrastructure, documentation, and tools.
- Use questionnaires to gather information from key stakeholders.
- Identify gaps and areas for improvement.
- Create a roadmap with clear milestones to achieve higher levels of data governance maturity.
- Regularly review and update the data governance program to ensure continuous improvement[4][5].
