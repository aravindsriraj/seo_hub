There isn't one definitive, universally recognized list of "open source data governance tools".  The landscape is quite diverse, and often a tool focuses on specific aspects of data governance, rather than encompassing the entire lifecycle.  Furthermore, "data governance" itself is a broad term.

Instead of a list of tools, consider the different aspects of data governance and the types of open-source projects that address them:

**Aspects of Data Governance Addressed by Open Source Projects:**

* **Data Cataloguing/Discovery:** Tools like Apache Atlas, Datahub (although Datahub is primarily managed via a service now, the core library & components is open-source), and others help you discover and understand what data you have. They often focus on metadata management.

* **Data Quality:** Tools like Apache Kafka streams or other batch processing systems (like Apache Spark or Hadoop) can be used to implement data quality checks and rules.  There isn't a specific "data quality" tool in the same way as a data catalog, but related systems are readily employed.

* **Data Access Management/Security:**  Open-source identity and access management systems (e.g., various authentication/authorization solutions) can be adapted to control access to data.  Specific data access management often relies on custom solutions or integrations.

* **Data lineage:**  Tools built around logging and tracking data flows (like some ELK stack components or specific logging solutions integrated with your data pipelines) can help understand the source and transformations of data.

* **Data Profiling:**  Many open-source tools for ETL (extract, transform, load) or data processing already include profiling capabilities. Think of tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, or specialized data analysis libraries.

* **Data Governance Policies:**  While there aren't dedicated tools for policy enforcement at the same level as data access tools, you may rely on scripting, rule engines, and custom code within your systems to implement and automate policies. Implementing policy engines or rules and integrating them with other tools is a common pattern.

* **Data Validation and Transformation:** Programming languages like Python with libraries such as Pandas and open-source ETL tools can be used for defining and enforcing data transformation and validation rules.


**Finding Relevant Projects:**

To find projects that might work for you, consider:

* **Specific needs:** What aspect of data governance most needs improvement in your organization?  (access management, quality, metadata?)
* **Existing tech stack:**  Do you have a preferred programming language or existing data processing infrastructure?  This will guide you toward fitting open-source projects.


**Instead of looking for "the tool," consider building a solution from the various open-source components you need.**  This approach often results in a more tailored and adaptable system.

**Important Caveats:**

* **Maintenance:** Open-source tools often require ongoing maintenance and updates. Be prepared for this.
* **Integration:** Connecting various open-source pieces together can present technical challenges.
* **Scalability:** Open-source tools might need scaling considerations based on your data volume and usage patterns.

In summary, there isn't a single tool for all data governance needs; rather, you often need a collection of components and tools custom fit to your needs, built around a solid open-source foundation, using languages/technologies you prefer.
