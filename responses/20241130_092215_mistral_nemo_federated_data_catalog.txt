A federated data catalog is a type of metadata repository that enables the discovery, understanding, and sharing of data assets across multiple, decentralized data sources. Here are some key aspects of a federated data catalog:

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: Unlike traditional, centralized data catalogs, a federated data catalog does not own or store the data. Instead, it maintains pointers or references to data located in diverse, distributed systems such as data lakes, data warehouses, databases, and other data repositories.

2. **Metadata Management**: A federated data catalog stores metadata, which is data about data. This can include information about data lineage, data schema, data usage, data governance policies, data owners, etc.

3. **Data Discovery**: The primary goal of a federated data catalog is to facilitate data discovery. It allows users to search for data based on various attributes like data source, data type, data owner, data usage, etc. It makes data easier to find and understand across different teams, departments, and locations.

4. **Data Governance and Security**: A federated data catalog can help in enforcing data governance policies and ensuring data security. It can track data usage, monitor access, and enforce access controls. It also promotes data transparency, which can help in data breach detection and response.

5. **Catalog Services**: Apart from metadata management and data discovery, a federated data catalog can also provide services like data profiling, data quality checking, data virtualization, etc.

6. **Support for interroperable data**: A federated data catalog can also manage metadata for heterogenous data residing in different technologies and formats. This supports data interoperability and makes it easier to integrate and analyze data from diverse sources.

7. **Scalability**: A well-designed federated data catalog can scale to manage metadata for large and complex data ecosystems.

Examples of tools and platforms that can be used to build or implement a federated data catalog include Apache Atlas, erwin Data Governance, Talend Data Catalog, Informatica Enterprise Data Catalog, and Enterpirse Data Catalog from Google Cloud.
