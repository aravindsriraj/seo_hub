Extracted Content:
Snowflake's data access control system is designed to be flexible, granular, and secure, leveraging a combination of two primary access control models: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC).

## Key Elements of Snowflake Access Control

### Securable Objects
- These are the entities to which access can be granted, such as databases, schemas, tables, views, and functions. By default, access to these objects is denied unless explicitly allowed by a grant[2][4][5].

### Roles
- Roles are entities to which privileges can be granted. Roles are assigned to users, and a user can have multiple roles. Roles can also be assigned to other roles, creating a role hierarchy that enables more granular control[2][4][5].

### Privileges
- Privileges define the specific actions that users or roles are allowed to perform on securable objects. Examples include SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, CREATE, and MODIFY. Privileges are managed using the GRANT and REVOKE commands[2][4][5].

### Users
- Users are entities that can log into Snowflake and are assigned one or more roles. Users gain access to securable objects through the privileges associated with their assigned roles[2][4][5].

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- In Snowflake's RBAC model, privileges are assigned to roles rather than directly to users. This allows for a more manageable and scalable access control system. Roles can be structured in a hierarchy, where higher-level roles can inherit the privileges of lower-level roles[2][4][5].

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Each object in Snowflake has an owner, which is typically the role that created the object. The owner role has all privileges on the object by default, including the ability to grant or revoke privileges on the object to other roles. This model allows for fine-grained control over object access[2][4][5].

## Access Control Framework
- Access to securable objects is allowed via privileges assigned to roles, which are then assigned to users or other roles. The role hierarchy enables complex access control scenarios where roles can inherit privileges from other roles.
- In non-managed schemas, the owner role or roles with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege can grant and revoke privileges. In managed schemas, only the schema owner or roles with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege can manage privileges[2][4].

## Best Practices and Additional Tools
- To maintain consistent and manageable access control, it is recommended to follow best practices such as creating a well-defined role hierarchy and using tools that integrate with Snowflake to enhance governance. For example, Atlan and Immuta can help centralize metadata, implement fine-grained access control, and enforce data policies across the entire data ecosystem[1][3].

## Fine-Grained Access Control
- Tools like Immuta can further enhance Snowflake's access control by implementing row-level security, column masking, and other granular access controls directly on Snowflake objects. This allows for dynamic policy application and ensures that sensitive data is protected while still being accessible to authorized users[3].

In summary, Snowflake's data access control is built on a robust framework that combines RBAC and DAC, providing a highly flexible and secure environment for managing access to data resources.
