An active metadata platform refers to a tool or service that not only stores metadata (data that describes and provides context to other data) but also actively manages, enhances, and analyzes this metadata to provide additional insights and functionality. Here are some key characteristics of an active metadata platform:

1. **Metadata Management:**
   - Creation, collection, and organization of metadata.
   - Integration with diverse data sources, including databases, data lakes, and enterprise applications.

2. **Metadata Profiling and enrichment:**
   - Automated analysis and tagging of metadata based on predefined or custom rules.
   - Manual enrichment through user contributions.

3. **Real-time or frequent updates:**
   - Actively keeps metadata current with changes in the data it describes, ensuring metadata's accuracy and relevance.

4. **Metadata-based recommendations and analytics:**
   - Provides insights based on metadata patterns and relationships, helping data users find and understand data better.
   - Offers data lineage and impact analysis, facilitating governance and management.

5. **Search and discovery:**
   - Actively optimizes search algorithms and structures based on usage patterns to provide better discovery results.
   - Automatically organizes and visualizes data landscapes.

6. **Metadata-driven data preparation and automation:**
   - Uses metadata to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent processes.
   - Enhances data transformation, curation, and preparation through active metadata management.

7. **Integration and extensibility:**
   - Integrates well with various data environments and tools to maximize effectiveness.
   - Supports extensions and customizations based on specific organization needs.

Examples of platforms that provide active metadata management capabilities include Microsoft's Data Catalog ( part of Azure Data Catalog), Apache Atlas, Google Cloud's Data Catalog, and Talend's Data Fabric. Each of these offers a slightly different mix of features to meet different organizations' metadata management needs.
