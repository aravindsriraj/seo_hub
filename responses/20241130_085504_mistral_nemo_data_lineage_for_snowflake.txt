This is crucial for understanding the data's journey, ensuring data quality, and performing impact analysis. Here's a simplified version of how data lineage works in Snowflake:\n\n1. **Source Tables**: Data lineage begins with the source tables. These could be tables in Snowflake or external data sources like CSV files, JSON files, or tables from other databases that have been loaded into Snowflake using COPY INTO or other methods.\n\n2. **Copy/Export**: When you COPY data from an external source into a Snowflake table or EXPORT data from a Snowflake table to an external location, a data lineage record is created. This record includes information about the source and target tables, the start and end times of the operation, and other details.\n\n3. **Create Table As (CTAS) and Alter Table Add Column**: When you create a new table using CTAS or add a column to an existing table using ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN, a data lineage record is created for each table mentioned in the FROM clause. This record tracks the initial creation of the table or the column.\n\n4. **Insert, Update, Delete**: When you perform DML operations like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a table, a data lineage record is created for each row affected by the operation. These records track the changes made to the data.\n\n5. **Data Load and Data Share**: Data lineage is also tracked when data is loaded into a table using a task or when tables are shared with other accounts using Data Share.\n\n6. **Query History**: Snowflake also keeps a history of queries run against tables, which can help track data lineage.

Data lineage in Snowflake helps track the movement and transformation of data from its source to its current location. This is crucial for understanding the data's journey, ensuring data quality, and performing impact analysis. Here's a simplified version of how data lineage works in Snowflake:

1. **Source Tables**: Data lineage begins with the source tables. These could be tables in Snowflake or external data sources like CSV files, JSON files, or tables from other databases that have been loaded into Snowflake using COPY INTO or other methods.

2. **Copy/Export**: When you COPY data from an external source into a Snowflake table or EXPORT data from a Snowflake table to an external location, a data lineage record is created. This record includes information about the source and target tables, the start and end times of the operation, and other details.

3. **Create Table As (CTAS) and Alter Table Add Column**: When you create a new table using CTAS or add a column to an existing table using ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN, a data lineage record is created for each table mentioned in the FROM clause. This record tracks the initial creation of the table or the column.

4. **Insert, Update, Delete**: When you perform DML operations like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a table, a data lineage record is created for each row affected by the operation. These records track the changes made to the data.

5. **Data Load and Data Share**: Data lineage is also tracked when data is loaded into a table using a task or when tables are shared with other accounts using Data Share.

6. **Query History**: Snowflake also keeps a history of queries run against tables, which can help track data lineage. You can query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Query_History view to get this information.

Here's a simple example of how to query data lineage information:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LINEAGE
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_schema'
AND TABLE_NAME = 'your_table';
```

This query will return information about the lineage of 'your_table' in the 'your_schema' schema. You can filter the results further by adding conditions for other columns like TABLE_TYPE, OPERATION_TYPE, etc.
