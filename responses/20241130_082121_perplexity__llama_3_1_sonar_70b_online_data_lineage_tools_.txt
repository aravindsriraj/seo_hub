Data lineage tools are essential for organizations to understand, visualize, and manage the flow of data through their systems. Here are some key tools and their features:

### Commercial Data Lineage Tools

#### MANTA
- Automatically scans the data environment to build a comprehensive map of all data flows.
- Provides lineage through a native UI and other channels, accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
- Offers end-to-end lineage tracking, impact analysis, and integrations with various data platforms[1][2][5].

#### Collibra Data Lineage
- Automatically maps relationships between data to show how data flows from system to system.
- Provides complete, end-to-end lineage visualization with both technical and business lineage.
- Features include automated lineage discovery, visualization capabilities, and detailed technical lineage at the table, column, transformation, and SQL query levels[1][2][5].

#### Octopai
- Offers a complete, in-depth automated lineage tool with three types of lineage: Cross-System Lineage, End-to-End Column Lineage, and Inner-System Lineage.
- Supports integration with a wide range of data platforms and tools, and automates lineage reporting and analytics[1][2].

#### Alation
- A data catalog tool that enables lineage tracking, data governance, and collaboration.
- Features include an intuitive interface, tools for data accuracy and analytics, machine learning for data navigation, and secure data-sharing[2].

#### Dataedo
- Allows automatic extraction of lineage or manual design of flows, with interactive diagrams to visualize data movement.
- Supports object and column-level data lineage[1].

#### Tokern
- A platform to collect, visualize, and analyze column-level data lineage in databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
- Offers API and library access for automating data quality triage and impact analysis[1].

#### Precisely (formerly Syncsort Zen)
- A metadata management tool that includes data lineage tracking, data cataloging, and other features for data governance.
- Provides a graphical interface to visualize data relationships and dependencies, and uses machine learning and AI for identifying and tagging assets[2].

### Open Source Data Lineage Tools

#### OpenMetadata
- An open-source solution that allows coding-limited users to create lineage maps without sacrificing granularity.
- Features include column-level lineage, query filtering, a no-code editor, and integration with dbt models[3][4].

#### Marquez
- Uses the OpenLineage standard for metadata and data lineage collection.
- Provides a user-friendly UI and a robust API for integrating with various data sources and tools[3][4].

#### Apache Atlas
- An open-source metadata management and governance tool that can also track and manage data lineage.
- Supports the OpenLineage standard and offers REST APIs for accessing and updating data lineage information[3][4].

#### Spline
- Originally designed for Apache Spark, but expanded to accommodate data lineage for other data sources.
- Offers APIs for collecting and querying data lineage, supports OpenLineage integration, and provides a web UI for displaying lineage information[3][4].

### Key Features to Look for in Data Lineage Tools

- **Automated Lineage Discovery**: The ability to automatically identify and map data flows.
- **Visualization Capabilities**: Interactive diagrams to visualize data movement and transformations.
- **Integration with Various Data Sources**: Support for different data platforms, including RDBMS, data warehouses, Hadoop, NoSQL, and cloud data sources.
- **Technical and Business Lineage**: The ability to provide both detailed technical lineage and high-level business lineage.
- **Scalability**: The capacity to handle large volumes of data and scale with the organizationâ€™s needs[1][2][5].

These tools help organizations ensure data transparency, trust, and compliance by providing a clear picture of where data comes from, how it is transformed, and where it is used.
