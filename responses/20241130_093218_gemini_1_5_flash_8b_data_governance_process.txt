* **Data Quality Assessment:**  Evaluating the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness of data. This involves defining data quality rules and metrics.
* **Data Impact Analysis:** Assessing the business impact resulting from poor data quality or inappropriate data use.

**2. Data Management Policies and Standards:**

* **Data Ownership and Responsibility:** Defining clear roles and responsibilities for data management, including who is accountable for data quality, security, and use.
* **Data Definitions and Semantics:** Establishing standardized definitions for data elements, ensuring consistent interpretations across the organization.
* **Data Classification and Security:** Categorizing data based on sensitivity and risk levels. Implementing access controls and security measures to protect sensitive data.
* **Data Retention and Archiving Policies:** Defining guidelines for how long data should be kept and how it should be archived.
* **Data Management Procedures:** Developing standardized procedures for accessing, updating, and using data.  This includes rules around data entry, validation, and update procedures.

**3. Data Quality Management:**

* **Monitoring and Validation:** Using checks and audits to ensure that data is accurate, reliable, and compliant.
* **Data Cleansing and Transformation:** Implementing processes to correct or improve data quality, and potentially to transform data into usable formats.
* **Data Profiling:** Creating a detailed description of your data to understand its structure and content and to measure data quality.

**4. Data Access and Use Management:**

* **Data Access Controls:** Defining and enforcing access permissions for data based on user roles and responsibilities.
* **Data Usage Policies:** Determining acceptable ways of using data within the organization, including restricting specific use cases and data limitations.
* **Data Sharing Agreements:** Managing how data is shared between different parts of the organization or with external partners.

**5. Data Security and Compliance:**

* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implementing measures to prevent sensitive data from being exposed or leaked.
