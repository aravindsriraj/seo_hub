The cost of a data catalog can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of catalog, its features, the size of the data environment, and the vendor. Here are some general pricing models and estimates for data catalog solutions:

1. **Open-source data catalogs**: Free or low-cost, as they are community-driven and often sponsored by organizations that use them.
2. **Cloud-based data catalogs**: Pricing is often based on the number of users, data sources, or features. Here are some examples:
	* Alation Data Catalog: $25-$50 per user/month (billed annually)
	* Collibra Data Catalog: $20-$50 per user/month (billed annually)
	* Informatica Data Catalog: $25-$50 per user/month (billed annually)
3. **On-premises data catalogs**: Pricing is often based on the number of CPUs, cores, or servers. Here are some examples:
	* IBM InfoSphere Data Catalog: $10,000-$50,000 per year (depending on the number of CPUs)
	* Oracle Enterprise Data Catalog: $15,000-$75,000 per year (depending on the number of CPUs)
4. **Automated data cataloging tools**: Pricing is often based on the number of data sources, tables, or rows processed. Here are some examples:
	* AWS Glue Data Catalog: $0.005 per data processing unit-hour (with a free tier)
	* Google Cloud Data Catalog: $0.007 per data processing unit-hour (with a free tier)
5. **Enterprise data catalog platforms**: Pricing is often based on the number of users, data sources, and features. Here are some examples:
	* Ataccama Data Catalog: $50-$200 per user/month (billed annually)
	* Talend Data Catalog: $30-$100 per user/month (billed annually)

Keep in mind that these estimates are rough and may not reflect the actual prices, as they can vary depending on the vendor, the specific requirements of your organization, and the level of support needed.

When evaluating data catalog pricing, consider the following factors:

1. **Total cost of ownership**: Include the costs of implementation, maintenance, and support.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the solution can grow with your organization's data needs.
3. **Features and functionality**: Only pay for the features you need, but also consider the costs of customization or additional features.
4. **Support and training**: Factor in the costs of support, training, and documentation.
5. **Integration**: Consider the costs of integrating the data catalog with other tools and systems in your ecosystem.

It's essential to request a custom quote from the vendor, as they can provide a more accurate estimate based on your specific requirements.
