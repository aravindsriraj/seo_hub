Unfortunately, "Alation alternatives" is too broad a request.  To get helpful suggestions, you need to clarify *what Alation does* and *what you need it for*.

Alation is a data cataloging and metadata management tool.  To suggest alternatives,  we need to know:

* **What specific features of Alation are you looking to replace or augment?**  (e.g., data discovery, lineage tracking, schema management, governance, API access, reporting, etc.)
* **What is the size and complexity of your data environment?** (e.g., small team, large enterprise, lots of data sources, specific database types)
* **What are your budget constraints?** (Alation can be expensive, so pricing considerations are crucial)
* **What is your existing technology stack?**  (Integration with existing tools is important)

Once you provide more context, I can suggest appropriate alternatives, ranging from open-source tools to commercial solutions.
