OpenMetadata and DataHub are two popular open-source metadata management platforms used to discover, catalog, and manage metadata across various data systems. While both platforms share similar goals, there are key differences in their design, features, and use cases.

Here's a comparison of OpenMetadata and DataHub:

**Similarities:**

1. **Metadata management**: Both platforms provide a centralized repository to store and manage metadata from various data sources, such as databases, data warehouses, data lakes, and data pipelines.
2. **Data discovery**: Both platforms enable data discovery, allowing users to search, browse, and understand the available data assets.
3. **Data governance**: Both platforms support data governance by providing features for data classification, data quality, and data lineage.

**Differences:**

1. **Architecture**:
	* OpenMetadata: Designed as a microservices-based architecture, with separate components for metadata ingestion, storage, and querying.
	* DataHub: Built using a monolithic architecture, with a single service handling metadata ingestion, storage, and querying.
2. **Metadata model**:
	* OpenMetadata: Uses a flexible, extensible metadata model based on JSON Schema, allowing for customization and adaptation to various data sources.
	* DataHub: Employs a more rigid metadata model, based on a predefined set of entities and relationships, which may require more effort to adapt to custom data sources.
3. **Ingestion mechanisms**:
	* OpenMetadata: Supports a wide range of ingestion mechanisms, including APIs, file-based ingestion, and integration with popular data platforms like Apache Airflow and Apache NiFi.
	* DataHub: Primarily relies on APIs for metadata ingestion, with some support for file-based ingestion.
4. **Scalability**:
	* OpenMetadata: Designed to scale horizontally, with support for distributed metadata storage and querying.
	* DataHub: While DataHub can handle large volumes of metadata, its monolithic architecture may limit its scalability compared to OpenMetadata.
5. **User interface**:
	* OpenMetadata: Offers a more modern, user-friendly interface with features like data lineage visualization and custom dashboards.
	* DataHub: Provides a more basic, functional interface, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
6. **Community and adoption**:
	* OpenMetadata: Backed by a growing community, with increasing adoption in the industry.
	* DataHub: Developed and maintained by LinkedIn, with a strong focus on internal adoption and usage.
7. **Licensing**:
	* OpenMetadata: Apache 2.0 licensed, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution.
	* DataHub: Also Apache 2.0 licensed, with similar freedoms.

**Choose OpenMetadata if:**

* You need a highly customizable metadata model to accommodate diverse data sources.
* You require a scalable, microservices-based architecture for large-scale metadata management.
* You prefer a modern, user-friendly interface with advanced features like data lineage visualization.

**Choose DataHub if:**

* You're already invested in the LinkedIn ecosystem and want a metadata management platform with strong internal support.
* You prioritize simplicity and ease of use over advanced features and customization options.
* You're looking for a battle-tested, production-ready platform with a strong focus on reliability and stability.

Ultimately, the choice between OpenMetadata and DataHub depends on your specific use case, organizational needs, and technical preferences.
