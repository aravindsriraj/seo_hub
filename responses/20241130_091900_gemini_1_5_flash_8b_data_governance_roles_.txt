Data governance roles vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of an organization, but common roles and responsibilities include:

**Core Data Governance Roles:**

* **Chief Data Officer (CDO):**  Often the overall leader of data governance.

They may not directly manage data governance teams, but oversee the process.
* **Data Governance Officer/Manager:**  Oversees the day-to-day data governance programs and activities.  This role develops and implements data governance policies, procedures, and standards.  They monitor data quality, identify data risks, and ensure compliance.
* **Data Stewards:**  The closest role to the data itself.  Data stewards are responsible for a specific set of data assets.  Their duties include understanding where data resides, defining data quality rules, managing data lineage, and ensuring the proper use of the data they own.  They might be business units (like marketing) or specific departments (like finance).
* **Data Quality Analyst/Manager:**  Focuses on ensuring the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness of data.  They develop and implement data quality rules, monitor data quality metrics, and identify data quality issues.

**Supporting Roles:**

* **Data Architects:**  Design the structure and organization of data within the enterprise, often working closely with data governance to align the data architecture with data policies.
* **Data Modelers:**  Create and maintain the essential blueprints for how data should be organized, specifying fields, relationships, and rules. These models are critical for ensuring consistent data definitions for all users.

* **Business Analysts:**  Work with business stakeholders to understand the data needs, and translate them into data governance policies and practices.
* **Legal/Compliance Representatives:**  Ensuring adherence to laws, regulations, and other compliance requirements relevant to data usage and protection.

A smaller organization might combine some of these roles, while a larger, more complex organization requires more specialized personnel.
