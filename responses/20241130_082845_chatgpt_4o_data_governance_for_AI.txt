Data Lifecycle Management**\nGovernance should account for the entire lifecycle of data in AI systems, from creation to destruction.\n\n- **Retention Policies:** Define how long data should be stored and ensure compliance with local and international laws.\n- **Archiving and Disposal:** Safely archive or dispose of data when it is no longer required without leaving traces or creating risks.\n- **Version Control:** Keep track of different versions of datasets and training data used across AI models.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Data Sharing and Collaboration**\nCollaboration on AI often involves the sharing of data, which must be done responsibly to protect intellectual property and privacy.\n\n- **Data-Sharing Agreements:** Clearly document rules for how data can be shared between parties, including intellectual property rights and obligations.\n- **Interoperability Standards:** Use common data standards to ensure smooth and consistent sharing between organizations and systems.\n- **Secure Sharing Mechanisms:** Employ secure methods such as encryption or federated learning to facilitate data sharing while maintaining confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### **8. AI-Specific Regulatory Compliance**\nBeyond general data laws, many jurisdictions are implementing AI-specific regulations that necessitate governance mechanisms.\n\n- **Adherence to AI-Specific Laws:** Stay updated on policies like the EU AI Act or NIST guidelines on AI.\n- **Explainability and Transparency:** Ensure data governance supports AI explainability, i.e., the ability to trace decisions back to specific data inputs.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Organizational Roles and Responsibilities**\nStrong data governance for AI requires a clear allocation of roles within the organization.\n\n- **Data Stewards:** Manage the quality, integrity, and security of data.\n- **AI Ethics Committees:** Oversee ethical considerations in AI and data usage.\n- **Training for Employees:** Provide AI developers, data engineers, and business teams with regular training on data privacy, security, and ethical practices.\n\n---\n\n### **10.
